# Genetic Algorithm Tutorial

In order to run this you will need to be running Python 3 and make sure you have the Numpy module installed.

To run the program go to the terminal and enter the following commands.<br>
<br>
`$cd path/to/files`<br>
<br>
`$python genetic_runner.py items.json`<br>
<br>
After this the program should begin to run and you can watch the process of the algorithm take place.
<br>
Considering changing the following:
<ul>
  <li>What happens with a greater number in the population?</li>
  <li>What about fewer?</li>
  <li>What happens if we make it a higher chance of mutation?</li>
  <li>What if we make mutation impossible?</li>
  <li>What if we change what attributes come from which parents?</li>
  <li>What if we test fitness in a different way? (Change the fitness function)</li>
</ul>
